Thank you for visiting, welcome on the GeoMapFish (GMF) community website!

The GeoMapFish application allows to build rich and extensible WebGIS in an easy and flexible way.
It is composed of a desktop WebGIS interface, an administration interface, an API for map integration
in thirdparty websites and a mobile version.

Besides the OGC-Standard web services, a MapFish protocol adapted to the efficient communication
between Client and Server is available. On this basis, complex and high performance web mapping 
applications can be built.

GeoMapFish combines some of the best Open Source tools in one application:

* V1: [OpenLayers 2](http://openlayers.org/two), [ExtJS](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/3.4.0/) and [GeoExt](http://geoext.org/v1/) on the client side
* V2: [OpenLayers 3](http://openlayers.org), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [ngeo](https://camptocamp.github.io/ngeo/master/apidoc/index.html) on the client side
* Python modules (especially Papyrus based on [Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/)) on the server side
* [MapFish Print](http://mapfish.github.io/mapfish-print-doc/#/overview), a Java servlet dedicated to print geographic documents
